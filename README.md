👋 Hello there, I'm isocat. Welcome to my profile! 🐱

Below is a brief description of myself, which will hopefully allow you to familiarise yourself with me.

Although I've created various Windows-based applications in the past, my programming experience is fairly limited and is something I've recently set out to improve.
As my knowledge increases, I plan on uploading some of the projects I create onto GitHub as a way of documenting my progress whilst simultaneously sharing my code for all to use.
Being a supporter of free open-source software, I believe that GitHub is the perfect platform to do this on!

I'm currently enrolled in university, undertaking a Bachelor's Degree of Computer Science and have created projects using HTML, CSS, PHP, C# and Python.
Although it is rather rudimentary, HTML is undoubtebly my favorite programming language due to its inherent simplicity and how my knowledge in it exceeds that of other programming languages.
I would like to eventually get into either a cybersecurity or software development position in the future, however web design will always be my favorite field of programming and I'll keep it at heart.

In terms of other interests, I love listening to new music in my free time. My predominant genres of interest are Experimental Hip Hop, Pop Rap, Psychedelic Rock/Soul and Electronic.
I suppose another fun fact about me is that I can identify the flags of all 190+ sovereign countries, as well as some territories. Although I'm not sure how impressive that is nowadays.

Well, thanks for stopping by! Whilst there isn't much on my profile yet I'm sure it'll grow over time.

Enjoy your Day/Evening/Night,
~ isocat
